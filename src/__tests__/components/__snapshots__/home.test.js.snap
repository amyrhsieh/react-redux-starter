    Thank you for checking out my demo React app! The purpose of this app is to serve as a starting point for any web app that uses React, Webpack, Redux, React Final Form, Jest/Enzyme tests, and all of the other packages used in this demo. Not everything is fleshed out, but the very basics are in place (e.g. a form using React Final Form; redux store, reducer and action creators; usage of Bootstrap styles) to give a taste of how each of the tools are used. Each feature can be fleshed out further, depending on the needs of the web app.
